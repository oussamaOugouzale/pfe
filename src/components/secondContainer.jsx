                    <h1>What is facial emotion recognition software?</h1>
                    <p>Emotion recognition or emotion detection software is a technology that uses artificial
                        intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to <strong>analyze and interpret facial
                            expressions
                            and emotions.</strong> </p>
                    <p>To this day, the most widely accepted theory of emotions is that of Dr. Paul Ekman, a renowned
                        American psychologist. He identified <strong>6 basic emotions</strong> and supported the view
                        that these emotions
                        are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct. Moreover, he found that they are
                        <strong>universal across different cultures</strong>, even in pre-literate cultures that
                        couldn’t have learned
                        these associations through modern media.

                    <h1>How emotion recognition works?</h1>
                    <p>Our experiences often consist of multiple emotions at once, which, in addition, come in many
                        different degrees, intensities, and qualities. Therefore, the emotion recognition software
                        within our FaceAnalysis package shows the <strong>probability distribution of each of the basic
                            emotions:</strong> happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust, as well as
                        neutral. </p>
                    <p>Our emotion recognition SDK allows you to <strong>detect emotions in real time</strong>, from
                        images or videos,
                        meaning you can analyze the emotions of people in real-world situations, thus making data-driven
                        business decisions.
